AIBEDO Reports
==============

This section contains reports on the AIBEDO project as part of the DARPA AI-Assisted Climate Tipping Point Modeling (ACTM) program.


Milestone 1
-----------

This milestone report expands on the model development details of hybrid model constituents: data-driven and physics-based components, list of datasets to be used for training and validating the model, and an elaborate list of input and output variables to be extracted from the datasets.

Milestone 2
-----------

This milestone report includes two major sections: (a) details on the 'alpha' model version of AIBEDO, specific architecture choices of sub-components, and lessons learned during the model development, and (b) data preprocessing steps and compatibility checks.

Milestone 3
-----------

The main objective of this milestone is to identify appropriate assessment metrics for the hybrid model and deliver prepared datasets that can be used for Phase 1 model development. In addition, this report includes updates on hybrid model development, outcomes of the initial model runs, and the methodology plan for upcoming modules.
