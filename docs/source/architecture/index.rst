Hybrid AI Model Architecture
============================


Our hybrid model for AIBEDO consists of two data-driven components: spherical-Unet for spatial network modeling and multi-timescale Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for temporal modeling. Both components will be infused with physics-based constraints to ensure the generalizability of spatial and temporal scales.
